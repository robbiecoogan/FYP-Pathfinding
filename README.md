# FYP-Pathfinding
I am currently working on this project for my Final Year Project at University.

You can left-click on the screen to set a node as 'intraversable', and can right-click to set it back to being traversable.

By pressing the 'F' key on the keyboard, the A-star pathfinding algorithm will be used to find a path from the agent's current position to the position of the mouse.
By pressing the 'G' key on the keyboard, the Jump Point Search algorithm will be used.
